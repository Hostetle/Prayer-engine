<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">John 3:3 Except a person be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Jesus went on to say that He was talking about a spiritual rebirth, other verses not listed here requires us to invite Jesus Spirit to come into our life, and allow Him to change us into His image if we want to have a relationship with God.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">The Bible states there is only one God, He's made up of the Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit and Jesus proved He was The Son of God by predicting that He would die for our sins and be raised again in 3 days. The Roman Guards made sure He was dead and sealed His tomb, but when Jesus arose on the 3rd day, the huge stone used to seal His tomb was rolled away by an Angel, in spite of the fact that Roman Guards were gaurding the tomb to make sure no one would remove Him because of His perdiction.</P>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">Over 500 hundred people saw him after He was raised from the dead. It is recorded to be true in more ancient manuscripts than the ideas of Plato or Aristotle. </p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">You may ask, what about other gods, and other religions? The Bible tells us that they are a Diversion created by Satan to deceive people. Satan hates God, but the only way he can hurt God is to hurt God's true followers "Christians". Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy, which is the opposite of Jesus teachings which require us to love, and forgive.</P>

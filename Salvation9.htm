<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">Isaiah 53:4 He **Refering to Jesus when He died on the cross** was wounded for our transgressions and was bruised for our iniquities. **Iniquities means immoral or wrong behavior.**</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">What all of these verses are saying is that Jesus must be asked to come into our lives by faith, we must accept His death on the cross as punishment for our sins, and recognize that our good deeds do not count in any way to help bring us any acceptance from God.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">The only thing that counts is our willingness to accept God's free gift of His sacrifice on the cross as payment for our sins, Jesus did however tell us to turn away from our sins and follow the values that He taught. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your might.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">The 2nd thing Jesus asked us to do is to Love your neighbor as yourself, this includes all the people your interact with on a daily basis. Jesus also said: "If ye love me, keep my commandments".</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">Note: Before we accept Jesus into our heart, we are unable to keep His commandments, but after we accept His pardon, we are much better equipped to keep them. **Pardon refers to God's willingness to erase our sins when we accept His free gift of Salvation**</p>
<p align="center"><font color="0033CC">Study your Bible daily to find the clues that reveal His amazing love for us, and all the secrets hidden in the Bible that show us who He designed us to be, and what our true purpose is for being in this world.</p>
